      <text class="matter-text text-block">The $itemName, is the block equivalent to the [item name=matter_scanner]. The main difference is, the $itemName is the only way to scan items. It also scans items and blocks twice as much as the [item name=matter_scanner], increasing their progress by 20%.</text>

    <title size="2" class="matter-text small-title">How to use</title>
    <text class="matter-text text-block">The $itemName requires power, in order to function. When an item is placed in the input slot, the analyzer will search for valid destinations.
      It will need to find a valid [item name=pattern_drive] to use as storage. The drives will be housed in [item name=pattern_storage]. The $itemName must be connected to a Matter Network to search for free pattern storage. It can only be connected trough it's back side.</text>

  <page class="padded-page">
    <text class="matter-text text-block">The Analyzer is smart enough to hold progression when pattern storage is not found. A [item name=network_flash_drive] can be used to limit the pattern storage blocks the Analyzer can interact with, by putting it in the network filter slot in the configurations tab.</text>
