        <text class="matter-text text-block">$itemName, is a machine, that uses transporter technology to materialize item patterns into their physical counterpart. It works by rearranging subatomic particles on a larger scale, by using [guide name=matter_plasma]. In short, it replicates items and blocks, thus its name, $itemName.</text>

        <title size="2" class="matter-text small-title">How To Use</title>
        <text class="matter-text text-block">Before you can replicate an item, you must have it's pattern. It can be obtained by using a [item name=matter_scanner] or a [item name=matter_analyzer]. Unfortunately the scanning process destroys the item.
            Every time the item is scanned, it's progress will increase. A Redstone signal, may required to start the replication process, depending on the redstone setting of the machine.
            [guide name=matter_plasma] is also required to replicate items. How much depends on the item itself.</text>
        <text class="matter-text">Be warned! The replication process produces high amounts of radiation. Without protective plating any living creature will receive large doses of radiation followed by a ton of negative potion effects, such as Hunger, Nausea, Fatigue,Weakness and Poison. To protect against radiation, a maximum of 5 [item name=tritanium_plate] can be used to protect the user from the deadly radiation. Each plate also decreases the area of effect.</text>

        <title size="2" class="matter-text small-title ">Matter Network</title>
        <text class="matter-text text-block">The $itemName can only be connected to its back side. Once connected to a network, the [item name=pattern_monitor] can be used to issue replication tasks, to all replicators connected.
            The $itemName once given a replication task, will search the Local Network for valid patterns.
            A [item name=network_flash_drive] can be used to filter machines with which the $itemName can communicate.</text>
