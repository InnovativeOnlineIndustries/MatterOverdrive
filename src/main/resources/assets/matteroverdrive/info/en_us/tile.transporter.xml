        <text class="matter-text text-block" style="width:180px">To accomplish that the $itemName requires FE energy based on the distance. It stores the quantum information of each atom and transfers it to a desired location. Every entity directly above the $itemName will be affected by the transportation. This means that multiple subjects can teleport at the same time. The $itemName must also be configured with the destination inates.</text>

        <title size="2" class="matter-text small-title">Destination</title>
        <text class="matter-text text-block">The destination consists of 3 values. The X, Y and Z inates of the world point. Each inate also shows the relative displacement/distance compared to the transporter itself. Each location stored in the transporter can be edited and renamed. Then only the selected location is used as a destination. </text>
