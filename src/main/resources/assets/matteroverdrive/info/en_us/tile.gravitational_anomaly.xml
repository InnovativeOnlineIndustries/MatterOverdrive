        <text class="matter-text text-block">These are naturally occurring Gravitational Anomalies. They attract Entities and break blocks.
            Each anomaly has it’s own mass and can feed on entities near its event horizon.
            Matter from each entity is added to the anomaly’s mass. Once the anomaly becomes massive enough it begins destroying the terrain around it.</text>
        <text class="matter-text text-block">Gravitational Anomalies are also the main component in the [guide name=fusion_reactor].</text>

        <text class="matter-text text-block">The radius of the anomaly can be seen on the [block name=gravitational_stabilizer guide=fusion_reactor] used to stabilize it. The further the block is, the less likely it is to be broken and consumed.
            The hardness of the block determines if the block will be broken by the anomaly.
            Dirt or redstone will be broken almost immediately but Obsidian will be broken by only the largest of anomalies.</text>

        <text class="matter-text text-block">Anomalies can get quite big and destroy a big part of your world.
            This is where [block name=gravitational_stabilizer] comes in.
            By putting a stabilizer on each side of the anomaly it's destructive force.</text>

        <text class="matter-text text-block">Stabilisers require a clear line of sight. Any solid block that block their vision to the anomaly will disable them.
            Transparent blocks on the other hand, will not block the stabilizers. The stabilizers can function up to 64 blocks away from an anomaly.</text>
